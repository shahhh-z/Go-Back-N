# Go-Back-N
My implementation of a Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol.

This takes around 12 seconds to execute, the range I got was 8 seconds to 16 seconds.

Check out my [Selective Repeat](https://github.com/shahhh-z/SelectiveRepeat) protocol, which is a modified version of this protocol.

Update: Fixed threading.

# How to Run
Simply download all of the files and run the test file in an IDE. An example log of the test is included in this repository.
